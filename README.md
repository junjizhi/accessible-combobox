# Accessible Combobox Implementation (WAI-ARIA v1.2)

When workinng the ARIA v1.1 combobox, I found a few problems with [their reference implementation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/listbox-combo.html).
This repo is an improved version of accessible combobox implementation with ARIA v1.2 compliance.

In particular, I added a few properties to the Combobox class:
  - Initial value
  - More callback hooks to make it to extend and implement other behaviors
  - ES6 class syntax
